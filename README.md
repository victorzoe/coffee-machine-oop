# â˜• Coffee Machine OOP

A simple object-oriented Python project simulating a coffee machine menu system.

This project was built as part of my daily Python practice to improve class design, object structure, and method interaction in Python. It demonstrates how to model drinks, ingredients, and selection menus using clean OOP principles.

## Features

- Define drinks with ingredients and cost
- Store a list of available drinks using `Menu` class
- Find drinks by name using search methods
- Basic structure for future integration with user interaction

## Tech

- Python 3
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
